Flames of Fury is a thrilling physics-based platform game in which you play as a fearless tomb raider escaping the fiery inferno that roils within ancient ruins. You must detonate bombs to destroy obstacles in your path, strategically placing them as you navigate the perilous journey ahead. Careful though! A fiery inferno advances more and more as you destroy objects. 

This game targets fast-paced platformer enthusiasts, quick thinkers, and action-puzzle enjoyers. Each level can be played in a different way. The strategy and non-linear exploration involved allows the game to be highly replayable.  It’s up to the player to discover the fastest path. 

High-speed gameplay and explosion gameplay mechanics offer players an inventive exploration of explosive combinations and paths. The player will feel continuously engaged and challenged with interesting roadblocks to overcome.

Player Goals and Objectives

*   Main Goal: Reach the exit of the ancient ruins as quickly as possible

*   Secondary Goal: Avoid being consumed by the fiery inferno, which speeds up when explosions destroy terrain in the ancient ruins

*   Types of Challenges:

*   A fiery inferno chases the player, creating time pressure and incentivizing snap judgements

*   There is terrain that requires the player to precisely place and time explosions to launch themselves in the correct direction

*   There are multiple ways to traverse the terrain, and there is strategy in determining which pathing will consistently yield the shortest time

*   There are obstacles, powerups, and destructible objects that require precise placement and timing of explosions to obtain or destroy

*   There is strategic decision making in deciding whether destroying terrain is worth it, since doing so could open up faster paths at the cost of speeding up the fiery inferno

*   Explosive supply is limited by quantity and cooldowns

*   Types of Conflicts

*   The player has limited explosives, and explosives are gated by a cooldown

*   There is terrain and obstacles that will block the player’s path

*   There is a fiery inferno that chases the player

*   The player must balance destroying terrain to increase traversal speed with increasing the speed of the inferno

*   Win/Loss Condition

*   The win condition is the player reaching the end of the level, or the exit of the ancient ruins

*   There is no loss condition, since if the player dies they will respawn at the furthest safe point, incurring a time penalty

Main Rules and Procedures

*   Operational Rules

*   The player cannot traverse outside the boundary of the ancient ruin levels

*   The player can move at a moderate pace and jump a small height

*   The player can throw explosives with a short, stacking cooldown and a limited supply

*   The player can detonate explosives in the order that they were thrown

*   The player can enter bullet time

*   Explosions will destroy all destructible objects and launch all non-destructible objects with high velocity away from the center of the explosion

*   Main Game Mechanic

*   The player can move with WASD

*   The player can jump with \[SPACE]

*   The player can enter bullet time by pressing \[Q]

*   The player can spawn a bomb by pressing \[RIGHT-CLICK]

*   The player can indicate where they want to throw the bomb by moving the cursor

*   The player can throw the bomb by releasing \[RIGHT-CLICK]

*   \[ESC] will display the current timer, resume, restart, and exit

Player Resources

*   The player’s primary resource are their explosives, which they use to control their momentum and reshape the environment towards their desired path

*   Since Flames of Fury is ultimately a run-type game, time is a primary resource. Players will have to make actions budgeting how much time each action takes

*   Powerups that impact explosive radius and strength are resources that can dramatically increase the player’s speed

*   Non-destructible objects are resources in that their momentum can be somewhat manipulated by explosions, and the player’s momentum can be manipulated through an accelerated non-destructible object

Boundaries and Constraints

*   The boundary of the game is the insides of the ancient ruins. Nothing in the scene - the player, destructible objects, indestructible objects, explosives, etc - can exit beyond the walls and ceilings of the ancient ruins

*   The player is constrained by the fiery inferno, which prevents backwards traversal and forces the player to move forward
