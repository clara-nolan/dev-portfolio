In my experience, activism that centers accessibility, features diverse perspectives, and uses art to spark curiosity is more effective at creating dialogue, which is one major reason why I think that inclusivity in the VFX and Animation industry is vital and should be promulgated. I believe that the VFX and Animation industry is in a unique position to be a positive influence on numerous people and age groups by expanding narratives and featuring characters from different walks of life. In my opinion, contributing to the goal of increasing inclusivity and diversity in the industry is especially important knowing that there has been a rise in book bans in the USA in combination with other restrictive legislature, meaning that projects that feature a wide array of experiences and voices in the storytelling process can help fill the gap in queer and other types of representation. Overall, cultural competency and diversity in the Animation and VFX sphere can help create more authentic and engaging content that resonates with a broader audience, which also helps with providing more equitable representation in media.

On the topic of equitable representation in media, a pertinent example of such impactful inclusion is the character Quill from the video game Moss, who communicates using American Sign Language (ASL). This design choice not only increases visibility for the Deaf community but also normalizes the use of ASL in mainstream media. By incorporating ASL, Moss invites players who may not be familiar with sign language to see its value and beauty, potentially inspiring them to learn ASL themselves. This increased interest can lead to greater accessibility and communication options for and with the Deaf community. Like in Moss, I see myself contributing to this goal by creating works and projects that imagine a world where disabled folks are not seen as an afterthought, but rather as integral and influential characters whose experiences and perspectives drive the narrative forward. By crafting these inclusive narratives, I aim to challenge and change perceptions, as well as increase visibility and awareness towards those who live with marginalized and intersectional identities.
