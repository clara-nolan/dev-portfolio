**3D Tools**

I have extensive experience with programs like Maya, Unreal, and Houdini since I have directly interacted with the API for them/created plugins. I have built 3D models in these programs, but have also created textures, shaders, and procedural workflows as well. I do not have as much experience with Houdini, but I am taking two classes this semester that focus on procedural design so I hope to expand my knowledge in terms of procedural buildings and textures. I aspire to create something like a castle or a cityscape using procedural workflows just to see how much time I can save in comparison to creating something similar manually. I would also like to experiment with something like cloth simulation since I am interested in fashion design, but not sure if I want to completely delve into physical fabrics/materials yet. 

**Programming** 

Due to that fact that I study computer science, programming is almost second nature to me at this point. I have completed numerous projects using languages like C#, C++, Python, GLSL, and more. Most of my projects revolve around computer graphics concepts, video games, and creative coding experiments. I would love to challenge myself by using a game engine like Unity to create a VR experience since that is one application I have not built before.

**Clay**  

I have experimented with quick dry clay before and one of my friends taught me some basic techniques in terms of how to make something kiln-ready, but otherwise I do not have any experience with this medium. The one clay project my friend helped me make was an incense holder that was in the shape of a boat. I would like to explore using clay further since talavera and Japanese pottery was always in my house growing up. I would like to balance making something like plates or bowls for daily life and sculptures/decorative art pieces. 

**Yarn** 

My paternal grandmother always wanted to me to get into knitting since she loves sewing, knitting, crafting in general, but it never stuck with me for some reason. The idea of being able to relate to my grandma by using this medium is what primarily drives me to explore it further. I would be interested in exploring knitting in a mathematical/computational way, since I know that different patterns require repetition.

**Metal** 

Visually, I love the look of something like armor or chainmail, however, I do not have any experience with metalworking, I've seen events at the library where you can create a ring or your own jewelry, so I was thinking I could attend a session if my schedule allows. I think an exploration into something combining the organic with inorganic could be interesting as well, where I could choose some kind of metal to be the inorganic matierial.
